Troubleshooting
===============
This section describes some common issues that can arise and possible solutions.

Issue #1
--------
I accidentally added too much data to lab 3 which is messing up my progress.
Deactivate the program.  Drop the tables from the database.  Restart the program.

Issue #2
--------
My signup page is allowing users to enter null fields in lab 6.
Deactivate the program.  Ensure that each input within the signup.html form has the required attribute.
If it does not, add the required field to the input.  Save the file.  Restart the program.

Issue #3
--------
I keep trying to run app.py but it keeps saying 'no such file or directory'.
Make sure you cd into the folder app.py exists in.  For example if you're in .../CMPT221, you will need to cd labs/lab-<lab you wish run app.py>.
